                        Just tap to fly, avoid the pipes, and try to beat your high score. 
                        It’s simple, fun, and something I really enjoyed creating. Hope you 
                        enjoy flapping through it as much as I did making it.🕹️🐤</p>

                            <p>This is where everything started coming together. 
                            After the ups and downs, I found my rhythm — excelling 
                            in studies while discovering my passions, making great friends,
                            and growing into the person I’m proud to be today. It’s not 
                            just a school; it’s the launchpad for my bigger dreams.</p>

                            <h3>🎓 Year 6 Academic Graduation – A Golden Start 🎓</h3>
                            <p>In my final year of primary school, I gave it my all 
                            and it paid off. This was the year I went full throttle. 
                            I didn’t just aim for excellence — I owned it. I walked away with the Top Student Overall, 
                            scooped Best Subject Awards in Bahasa Melayu, English, Mathematics, Science, Sejarah, Pendidikan Islam, 
                            and Music, and was honoured with the ultimate trio: Tokoh Murid, Tokoh Akademik, and Tokoh Ko-akademik. 
                            Every subject became a stage — and I showed up ready to perform.</p>

                            <p>From 7th to 9th July 2023, I participated in the GENIUS Model United Nations Conference 
                            representing the USA for the council of UNEP. held at Pusat PERMATApintar Negara UKM. I connected 
                            with bright-minded students from all over Malaysia and even met passionate delegates from other 
                            countries. This extraordinary experience deepened my understanding of diplomacy, global issues and 
                            further increased my confidence and enhanced my social skills.

                            <p>Secondary school? I came in sprinting. I ended the year with a perfect 10A’s, 
                            claiming the title of Top Student in my Batch. It wasn’t just about getting high 
                            marks — it was about mastering new subjects, pushing my limits, and proving that 
                            excellence doesn’t take a break after primary school. I set the bar high, and then 
                            jumped over it with focus, effort, and a mindset built for growth.</p>

                            <p>In 2024, I received the Gold Award (Senior Category) in the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition for my 
                            essay "Steps to Tackle The Climate Crisis." Competing among tens of thousands of students globally, I showcased 
                            my passion for sustainability, strong command of the English language, and the power of youth-driven change.</p>

                            stayed focused and learned from every challenge. Alhamdulillah, 
                            that dedication led to me earning Best Subject Awards in English, 
                            Mathematics, Pendidikan Islam, Asas Sains Komputer, and Geografi. 
                            To top it off, I was awarded the Top Student in my Batch — a

                            <p>Over the years, I’ve committed myself to memorizing key surahs of the 
                            Holy Quran, including Ar-Rahman (78 ayat), Al-Waqi'ah (96 ayat), Yasin 
                            (83 ayat), Al-Mulk (30 ayat), As-Sajdah (30 ayat), and the entire Juz 30 
                            (37 surahs). This journey is more than memory — it's a testament to discipline, 
                            dedication and perseverance. It continues to guide me in 
                            becoming a better version of myself, both in academics and in life, while 
                            reminding me that there is always more to learn, understand, and improve.
